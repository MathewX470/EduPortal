EduPortal is a web-based application designed to streamline and manage academic and administrative tasks related to students in educational institutions. Developed using PHP, this system provides an efficient and user-friendly platform for storing, retrieving, and processing student data. It allows institutions to effectively manage student records, grades, attendance, and other essential information in a secure and organized manner.

The system is built with a multi-tier architecture that separates the presentation, logic, and data layers, ensuring scalability and ease of maintenance. The front-end is developed using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive and responsive user interface. PHP handles server-side scripting, including data processing, user authentication, and database interactions. MySQL is used as the backend database for storing student-related information.

Key features of the system include user login, role-based access control for various user types (admin, faculty, student, parent), grade tracking and attendance monitoring. The system also ensures data integrity and security through encryption and validation mechanisms to protect sensitive user data.

EduPortal is designed to reduce administrative workload, improve data accuracy, and enhance communication between students, parents, faculty and staff. It is built with scalability in mind, allowing for future expansions such as system integrations or additional features. Its modular architecture makes it easy to extend or customize to meet the specific needs of the institution.
